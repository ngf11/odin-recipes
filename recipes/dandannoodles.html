        <p><em>A Dan Dan Noodles recipe that's tried, true, and authentic. With this recipe, you can try out this spicy, numbing Sichuan classic at home!</em></p>
        <p>The dandanmian originated in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. The original dish is served with no soup in a small bowl covered in a mala meat sauce and pickled vegetables, with peanuts and spring onions served on top. The soup variant is from Hong Kong and is more widespread across the rest of China but it is uncommon in Sichuan itself where the authentic style dominates.</p>
