    <p>Thai congee, known as Jok (pronounced joke) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand">Thailand</a>, is a rice porridge breakfast dish that is commonly served with pork meatballs and a variety of Thai condiments and topping such as fried onions and garlic, chiles, fish sauce, sliced ginger, green onions, and cilantro.</p>
    <h3>Ingredient</h3>
    <h5>FOR THE CONGEE:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1-2 cups rice cooked in pork broth or chicken broth or water</li>
        <li>1-2 eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>FOR THE PORK MEATBALLS:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 pound ground pork</li>
        <li>1-2 cloves garlic, diced</li>
        <li>1-2 tsp fish sauce or soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>SEASONINGS, TO TASTE</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Ginger, sliced into matchsticks</li>
        <li>Scallions, chopped</li>
        <li>Fried garlic and/or shallots</li>
        <li>Fish sauce and/or soy sauce</li>
        <li>Black or white pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <Li>Rinse 1 cup of white rice in water a few times.</Li>
        <li>Add 2 quarts of water or broth and bring to a boil.  Turn heat down and simmer gently for 60 â€“ 90 minutes until rice breaks down and forms a porridge-like consistency.  Stir frequently to avoid burning and add more water if needed.</li>
        <li>While rice is cooking, in a medium bowl, mix the ground pork with the garlic and fish sauce. Form the mixture into bite-sized meatballs.</li>
        <li>Transfer one serving of the rice (about 1 cup) to a separate pot.  Add a little more water or broth if needed (I usually add chicken or pork broth) and return to a simmer. Add the pork meatballs and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes until fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Add 1-2 eggs and poach for a few minutes, or until the egg white form and the yolks remain runny.</li>
        <li>Remove the congee from the heat (the eggs will continue to cook in the hot broth).</li>
    </ol>
