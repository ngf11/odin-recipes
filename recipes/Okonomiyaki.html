        <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions</li>

        <h5>Okonomiyaki Flour Blend:</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>2 cups finely ground high gluten flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sweet potato starch </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plus 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons tablespoon nori powder</li>

        </ul>
        <h5>Tempura Crunchies</h5>

        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup cornstarch </li>

        <li>Oil, for frying </li>


       </ul>
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       

       <ol>
        <Li>For the okonomiyaki batter: Whisk together the Okonomiyaki Flour Blend, water, eggs and salt in a large bowl. Fold in the cabbage.</Li>
        <li>For serving: Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Drizzle with a small amount of oil. Scoop 1/2 cup okonomiyaki batter into the center of the skillet. Drape 3 pieces of pork belly over the top, uncooked side of the pancake. Cook the pancake until the bottom is golden brown and crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip to the pork belly side. Cook until the belly is crispy and the center of the pancake is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Slide out of the skillet and repeat with the remaining batter and pork belly to make 4 pancakes total. </li>
        <li>To finish the okonomiyaki: Heat some oil in a skillet and cook the eggs to desired doneness. We prefer sunny-side up because the runny yolk adds a delicious richness.  </li>
        <li>Top each pancake with an egg. Drizzle each with Tokyo Sauce and mayonnaise. Sprinkle with tempura crunchies and finish with cilantro and scallions. </li>
        <li>Okonomiyaki Flour Blend:
        Whisk together the high gluten flour, sweet potato starch, baking powder, nori powder and guar gum in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Tempura Crunchies:
            Whisk together the flour, cornstarch and beer in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat about 2 inches of oil in a large pot and attach a deep fry fat thermometer to the side. Heat to 375 degrees F. Drizzle the tempura batter into the oil and fry, stirring, until golden brown, about 1 minute. Remove with a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool.</li>
